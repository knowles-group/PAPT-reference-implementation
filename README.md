Reference implementation for Perturbation-Adapted Perturbation Theory


## Description
Perturbation-Adapted Perturbation Theory is described at http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0079853 . This repository contains a reference implementation for it, with the spin-orbital equations coded clearly.  It is not intended for production, as the code is slow.
